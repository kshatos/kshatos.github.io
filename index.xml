      <description>My name is Keagan. I began my career by studying Aerospace engineering, but fell in love with coding through the simulation and modeling I did in school. I decided to change paths and now I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer who loves to use coding to explore my passions for math, physics, graphics, and music.
This blog is a place where I post about my personal projects, things I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about, and whatever else has captured my interest.</description>

      <description>RedGreenBlueMetallicRoughnessBrightnessWith the proper framework in place and point lights under our belt, how can we handle more complicated lighting conditions?
Ambient Light Most scene objects are lit largely by ambient light. This is just the light reflected off of the background objects in the scene. The ambient light from a scene can be modeled as a continuum of point lights, infinitely far away.</description>

      <description>Rendering 3D scenes is an important part of communicating information to the user in many software applications. Basing the rendering algorithm on a physical model of light can produce images that are more realistic, and therefore can provide the user a more intuitive understanding of the 3D scenes (as well as often being more pleasing to the eye). So how does light work, and how can we simulate it in our rendering algorithms?</description>

      <title>Physically Based Rendering Implementation</title>

      <description>RedGreenBlueMetallicRoughnessOverview This demo was made using javascript, webGL, and the glMatrix library. It is an implementation of the PBR algorithm outlined in my previous post. The scene consists of a sphere, three point lights, and some ambient lighting. The camera spins around the sphere at a constant speed. Most of the code is boiler plate, so I&amp;rsquo;ll focus mostly on the shader code.</description>
